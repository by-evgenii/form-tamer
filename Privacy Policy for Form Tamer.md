# Privacy Policy for Form Tamer

Form Tamer does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal or sensitive user data.

- The extension only modifies form attributes (`pattern`, `required`, etc.) locally in the browser DOM.
- No information is sent to external servers.
- The only storage used is `chrome.storage.sync` to save extension preferences (enabled/disabled state, toggle options).
- These preferences are stored locally in the user's browser and are not shared.
